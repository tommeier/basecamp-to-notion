## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Ruby 3.2+
- Basecamp OAuth App credentials (client ID, client secret)
- Notion API integration token and page access

Install Ruby dependencies:

```bash
gem install sqlite3
```

---

## üß© Setup

### 1. Prepare Basecamp OAuth App

Basecamp no longer uses Personal Access Tokens.

Instead, create an OAuth app:

1. Go to: [Basecamp OAuth App Registration](https://launchpad.37signals.com/registrations/new)
2. Register a new application:
   - Name: **Basecamp to Notion Migrator**
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:4567/callback`
3. After creation, copy:
   - **Client ID** ‚Üí `BASECAMP_CLIENT_ID`
   - **Client Secret** ‚Üí `BASECAMP_CLIENT_SECRET`
4. Find your **Basecamp Account ID**:
   - Visit: https://3.basecamp.com/
   - Note the number in the URL: `https://3.basecamp.com/123456789/`

### 2. Prepare Notion Integration

1. Go to: [Notion My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Create a new integration:
   - Name: **Basecamp to Notion Migrator**
   - Give full permissions:
     - ‚úÖ Insert content
     - ‚úÖ Read content
     - ‚úÖ Update content
3. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** ‚Üí `NOTION_API_KEY`
4. Share your target Notion page:
   - Go to the Notion page you want to use as the root
   - Click **Share**
   - Add your integration to give it access
5. Get your **Notion Root Page ID**:
   - Copy link to your page
   - Example: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/Your-Page-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`
   - Use: `abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`

### 3. Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in all values:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Fill in:
- ‚úÖ `BASECAMP_CLIENT_ID`
- ‚úÖ `BASECAMP_CLIENT_SECRET`
- ‚úÖ `BASECAMP_REDIRECT_URI`
- ‚úÖ `BASECAMP_ACCOUNT_ID`
- ‚úÖ `NOTION_API_KEY`
- ‚úÖ `NOTION_ROOT_PAGE_ID`

Optional filters:
- `FILTER_PROJECT_LABEL` (e.g., "Marketing HQ")
- `FILTER_TOOL_NAME` (e.g., "chat")

---

## üöÄ Usage

Once `.env` is prepared, run:

```bash
ruby basecamp_to_notion_via_api.rb
```

- ‚úÖ Creates Notion pages under your selected root
- ‚úÖ Auto-generates migration banners with Basecamp links
- ‚úÖ Logs progress and API payloads to `./tmp/`
- ‚úÖ Progress is saved in `sync_progress.db`
- ‚úÖ Resume safely after interruption!

- **Include archived Basecamp projects**:

  ```bash
  INCLUDE_ARCHIVED=true ruby basecamp_to_notion_via_api.rb
  ```
---

## üß© Filters (Optional)

You can narrow the scope of migration:

**Project label filter:**
Only sync projects matching label (partial, case-insensitive).

```env
FILTER_PROJECT_LABEL="Marketing HQ"
```

**Tool name filter:**
Only sync specific Basecamp tool types.

Valid values:
```
message_board, schedule, vault, chat, todoset, kanban_board, questionnaire, inbox
```

Example:

```env
FILTER_TOOL_NAME="chat"
```

‚úÖ Filters are safe ‚Äî progress tracker and resume flow fully supported.

---

## üß≠ Progress Tracking

- Local SQLite: `sync_progress.db`
- Tracks:
  - ‚úÖ Projects
  - ‚úÖ Tools
  - ‚úÖ Items (messages, chats, todos...)
- Resume anytime: re-run the script!

Inspect manually:

```bash
sqlite3 sync_progress.db
```

Final sync report:
‚Üí Written to `sync_report.json` at end of run.

---

## üß© Reset Mode

If you want to perform a full fresh sync, starting from a clean state, you can enable `RESET` mode.

Set the environment variable:

```bash
RESET=true ruby basecamp_to_notion_via_api.rb
```

---

## üß© Limitations & Notes on Files and Assets

### üöß Basecamp Files Are Protected

- Basecamp's media files require authentication.
- They are **not** public.
- ‚úÖ API fetches them during sync, but Notion API currently does not support uploading.

### üöß Notion API Limitation

- No file upload support (yet).
- ‚úÖ Rich text, embeds, links, and external media **are** supported.
- ‚úÖ External services (e.g., YouTube, Giphy) work well.

### ‚úÖ Clean Fallback

- Each Notion page includes a yellow migration banner:
  > üèïÔ∏è Migrated from Basecamp on DD/MM/YYYY ‚Äî üîó https://3.basecamp.com/...

- For media:
  - ‚úÖ External links are preserved.
  - ‚úÖ Internal Basecamp assets include source link.
  - ‚ùå No broken placeholders.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

Logs:
‚Üí API calls and Notion block payloads are saved to `./tmp/`

Schema:
‚Üí Auto-created, or run manually:

```bash
ruby database/schema.rb
```

SQLite progress DB:
‚Üí Inspect with:

```bash
sqlite3 sync_progress.db
```

Debug mode:
‚Üí Payload dumps in `./tmp/`
‚Üí Safe to delete between runs.

---

## ‚úÖ Status: Ready ‚úÖ

- Fully tested end-to-end
- Multi-project and multi-hour runs safe
- Resume support: ‚úÖ
- Migration banners ‚úÖ
- Progress DB ‚úÖ
- Sync reports ‚úÖ

---

## üìã Roadmap (Potentially)

- [ ] Bug: Some figcaptions are doubling up, given our issues with assets I've not resolved this yet
- [ ] Delta sync: sync only updated Basecamp content
- [ ] Parallelise projects (right now we parallelise tools per project)
- [ ] Media upload support (when Notion API allows)

## üì© Questions?

If you get stuck:
- ‚úÖ Check `tmp/` for debug logs
- ‚úÖ Review `sync_progress.db`
- ‚úÖ Open any handler file to customize Notion formatting

---

### ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Will `RESET=true` delete my existing Notion pages?**
A: No. RESET only clears local files and progress tracking. Existing Notion pages must be deleted manually if you want a fully clean start.

**Q: Can I resume a sync if my internet drops?**
A: Yes! The script is checkpointed and safe to resume. Simply run it again without `RESET=true`.

**Q: Can I run with filters and RESET together?**
A: Yes. For example:
```bash
RESET=true FILTER_PROJECT_LABEL="My Project" ruby basecamp_to_notion_via_api.rb
