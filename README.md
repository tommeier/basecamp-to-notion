## ⚙️ Requirements

- Ruby 3.2+
- Basecamp OAuth App credentials (client ID, client secret)
- Notion API integration token and page access

Install Ruby dependencies:

```bash
gem install sqlite3
```

---

## 🧩 Setup

### 1. Prepare Basecamp OAuth App

Basecamp no longer uses Personal Access Tokens.

Instead, create an OAuth app:

1. Go to: [Basecamp OAuth App Registration](https://launchpad.37signals.com/registrations/new)
2. Register a new application:
   - Name: **Basecamp to Notion Migrator**
   - Redirect URI: `http://localhost:4567/callback`
3. After creation, copy:
   - **Client ID** → `BASECAMP_CLIENT_ID`
   - **Client Secret** → `BASECAMP_CLIENT_SECRET`
4. Find your **Basecamp Account ID**:
   - Visit: https://3.basecamp.com/
   - Note the number in the URL: `https://3.basecamp.com/123456789/`

### 2. Prepare Notion Integration

1. Go to: [Notion My Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Create a new integration:
   - Name: **Basecamp to Notion Migrator**
   - Give full permissions:
     - ✅ Insert content
     - ✅ Read content
     - ✅ Update content
3. Copy the **Internal Integration Token** → `NOTION_API_KEY`
4. Share your target Notion page:
   - Go to the Notion page you want to use as the root
   - Click **Share**
   - Add your integration to give it access
5. Get your **Notion Root Page ID**:
   - Copy link to your page
   - Example: `https://www.notion.so/workspace/Your-Page-abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`
   - Use: `abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890`

### 3. Configure `.env`

Copy `.env.sample` to `.env` and fill in all values:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Fill in:
- ✅ `BASECAMP_CLIENT_ID`
- ✅ `BASECAMP_CLIENT_SECRET`
- ✅ `BASECAMP_REDIRECT_URI`
- ✅ `BASECAMP_ACCOUNT_ID`
- ✅ `NOTION_API_KEY`
- ✅ `NOTION_ROOT_PAGE_ID`

Optional filters:
- `FILTER_PROJECT_LABEL` (e.g., "Marketing HQ")
- `FILTER_TOOL_NAME` (e.g., "chat")

---

## 🚀 Usage

Once `.env` is prepared, run:

```bash
ruby basecamp_to_notion_via_api.rb
```

- ✅ Creates Notion pages under your selected root
- ✅ Auto-generates migration banners with Basecamp links
- ✅ Logs progress and API payloads to `./tmp/`
- ✅ Progress is saved in `sync_progress.db`
- ✅ Resume safely after interruption!

---

## 🧩 Filters (Optional)

You can narrow the scope of migration:

**Project label filter:**
Only sync projects matching label (partial, case-insensitive).

```env
FILTER_PROJECT_LABEL="Marketing HQ"
```

**Tool name filter:**
Only sync specific Basecamp tool types.

Valid values:
```
message_board, schedule, vault, chat, todoset, kanban_board, questionnaire, inbox
```

Example:

```env
FILTER_TOOL_NAME="chat"
```

✅ Filters are safe — progress tracker and resume flow fully supported.

---

## 🧭 Progress Tracking

- Local SQLite: `sync_progress.db`
- Tracks:
  - ✅ Projects
  - ✅ Tools
  - ✅ Items (messages, chats, todos...)
- Resume anytime: re-run the script!

Inspect manually:

```bash
sqlite3 sync_progress.db
```

Final sync report:
→ Written to `sync_report.json` at end of run.

## 🧩 Limitations & Notes on Files and Assets

### 🚧 Basecamp Files Are Protected

- Basecamp's media files require authentication.
- They are **not** public.
- ✅ API fetches them during sync, but Notion API currently does not support uploading.

### 🚧 Notion API Limitation

- No file upload support (yet).
- ✅ Rich text, embeds, links, and external media **are** supported.
- ✅ External services (e.g., YouTube, Giphy) work well.

### ✅ Clean Fallback

- Each Notion page includes a yellow migration banner:
  > 🏕️ Migrated from Basecamp on DD/MM/YYYY — 🔗 https://3.basecamp.com/...

- For media:
  - ✅ External links are preserved.
  - ✅ Internal Basecamp assets include source link.
  - ❌ No broken placeholders.

---

## 🛠️ Development

Logs:
→ API calls and Notion block payloads are saved to `./tmp/`

Schema:
→ Auto-created, or run manually:

```bash
ruby database/schema.rb
```

SQLite progress DB:
→ Inspect with:

```bash
sqlite3 sync_progress.db
```

Debug mode:
→ Payload dumps in `./tmp/`
→ Safe to delete between runs.

---

## ✅ Status: Ready ✅

- Fully tested end-to-end
- Multi-project and multi-hour runs safe
- Resume support: ✅
- Migration banners ✅
- Progress DB ✅
- Sync reports ✅

---

## 📋 Roadmap (Potentially)

- [ ] Delta sync: sync only updated Basecamp content
- [ ] Parallelise projects (right now we parallelise tools per project)
- [ ] Media upload support (when Notion API allows)

## 📩 Questions?

If you get stuck:
- ✅ Check `tmp/` for debug logs
- ✅ Review `sync_progress.db`
- ✅ Open any handler file to customize Notion formatting
