# utils/basecamp_session.rb
# Manages a single, reusable Selenium session for Basecamp authentication.
# It captures the session cookies once and provides them to Net::HTTP requests
# via Utils::MediaExtractor.basecamp_headers.
#
# Usage:
#   Utils::BasecampSession.ensure_cookies!
#   # subsequent requests can use Utils::MediaExtractor.basecamp_headers
#
# The session remains open for the lifetime of the script so that cookies stay
# fresh. On exit, the driver is quit automatically.
